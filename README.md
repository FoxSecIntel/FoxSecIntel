# 🦊 FoxSecIntel  

**FoxSecIntel** is a personal project space where I publish tools for threat intelligence, network attribution, and automated analysis workflows.

🔍 I focus on:
- Cloud misconfiguration, vulnerabilites & threats
- Useful Chrome extensions
- DMARC, SPF, and DKIM validation tooling (`dmarc.exe`)
- ASN, BGP, and routing intelligence (`BGP-Intel`, `ASN-Analysis`)
- Lightweight open-source tools for Tier-1 SOC analysts

## 🎯 Mission

To build fast, focused, and usable tooling that empowers security teams to respond with clarity and speed ; especially at the network and infrastructure layer.

## 📦 Featured Projects (designed for blue team analysts on the front line)
- **[`cloud-hun`](https://github.com/FoxSecIntel/cloud-hun)** – A lightweight AWS misconfiguration & exposure hunter leveraging free tier, AWS CLI and reproducible lab environments.
- **[`dmarc.exe`](https://github.com/FoxSecIntel/dmarc.exe)** – Full-stack DMARC record validation, RUA parsing, and AbuseIPDB integration.
- **[`BGP-Intel`](https://github.com/FoxSecIntel/BGP-Intel)** – BGP triage toolkit with IP/ASN enrichment, origin mismatch checks (`bgp_hijack_check.py`), and RPKI validation (`rpki_check.py`) for potential hijack and route-leak detection.
- **[`link-inspector-chrome-extension`](https://github.com/FoxSecIntel/link-inspector-chrome-extension)** – Extracts, deduplicates, and exports webpage links for quick triage.
- **[`sensitive-info-scanner-chrome-extension`](https://github.com/FoxSecIntel/sensitive-info-scanner-chrome-extension)** – Scans page text for potential sensitive patterns (emails, IPs, keywords, phone numbers) with CSV/JSON export.
- **[`pomodoro-timer`](https://github.com/FoxSecIntel/pomodoro-timer)** – MV3-safe productivity timer extension with resilient service-worker timing, focus/break modes, and badge countdown.
- **[`PhishSense`](https://github.com/FoxSecIntel/PhishSense)** – PhishSense is both an AI-powered phishing triage tool and a hands-on learning ground for AI security best practices.
- **[`Google and Shodan Dorking`](https://github.com/FoxSecIntel/GoogleAndShodanDorking)** – A curated, SOC-ready list of Google and Shodan dorks
- **[`Vulnerability Analysis`](https://github.com/FoxSecIntel/Vulnerability-Analysis)** – Rapid CVE lookup with clean output for triage-ready insights
- **[`Openclaw-audit`](https://github.com/FoxSecIntel/Openclaw-audit)** – Python deployment auditor for OpenClaw misconfigurations, permission hygiene, and selected CVE exposure checks

## 🔧 Roadmap Ideas

- BGP hijack detection toolkit
- Autonomous honeynet-to-ASN attribution
- Passive DNS correlation for abuse indicators
- Pre-processing modules for TIP ingestion

## 🧠 Why?

I build tools to solve problems I encounter in threat intelligence and vulnerability management ; with a preference for modular CLI-driven utilities that can scale.

## 🌐 Follow or Contribute

This space evolves constantly. Watch the repos or open a discussion if you're interested in integrating or using any of the tooling.
