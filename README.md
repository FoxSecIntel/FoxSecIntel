# 🦊 FoxSecIntel  

**FoxSecIntel** is a personal project space where I publish tools for threat intelligence, network attribution, and automated analysis workflows.

🔍 I focus on:
- DMARC, SPF, and DKIM validation tooling (`dmarc.exe`)
- ASN, BGP, and routing intelligence (`BGP-Intel`, `ASN-Analysis`)
- Lightweight open-source tools for Tier-1 SOC analysts

## 🎯 Mission

To build fast, focused, and usable tooling that empowers security teams to respond with clarity and speed ; especially at the network and infrastructure layer.

## 📦 Featured Projects

- **[`dmarc.exe`](https://github.com/FoxSecIntel/dmarc.exe)** – Full-stack DMARC record validation, RUA parsing, and AbuseIPDB integration.
- **[`BGP-Intel`](https://github.com/FoxSecIntel/BGP-Intel)** – AS path enrichment and live prefix monitoring with public BGP sources.
- **[`link-inspector-chrome-extension`](https://github.com/FoxSecIntel/link-inspector-chrome-extension)** – Scrapes all links from the current webpage.
- **[`PhishSense`](https://github.com/FoxSecIntel/PhishSense)** – AI-based phishing email explainer.
- **[`PhishSense`](https://github.com/FoxSecIntel/GoogleAndShodanDorking)** – A curated, SOC-ready list of Google and Shodan dorks

## 🔧 Roadmap Ideas

- BGP hijack detection toolkit
- Autonomous honeynet-to-ASN attribution
- Passive DNS correlation for abuse indicators
- Pre-processing modules for TIP ingestion

## 🧠 Why?

I build tools to solve problems I encounter in threat intelligence and vulnerability management ; with a preference for modular CLI-driven utilities that can scale.

## 🌐 Follow or Contribute

This space evolves constantly. Watch the repos or open a discussion if you're interested in integrating or using any of the tooling.
